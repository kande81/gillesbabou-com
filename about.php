        Hi, I'm Gilles Babou. First and foremost I would like to thank you for
        taking the time to visit my online photography gallery.
        <p class="main-text__secondpara">
          I was born in Cameroon and grew up in Germany, France, England, Israel
          and the United States. After living for 10 years in the east coast of
          the U.S, I moved to Los Angeles in 2010 where I discovered a love for
          street-photography after stumbling upon the works of Henri Cartier
          Bresson and of Vivian Maier. Those two giants of street-photography
          were the inspiration that drove me to purchase my first camera in my
          early thirties and started exploring the streets of Los Angeles with
          my camera in hand seeking to capture those fleeting moments that give
          us an insight into the human condition.
